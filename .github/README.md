> I must give credit where it's due, my setup is built on top of Neovim's [NvChad](https://nvchad.com/) flavour, created by the awesome [@sciduck](https://github.com/siduck)

I've setup language servers for `Golang`, `Typescript` and `Javascript`. Also added debugger, code completions and auto-formatters.

## What is it?

- NvChad is a neovim config written in lua aiming to provide a base configuration with very beautiful UI and blazing fast startuptime (around 0.02 secs ~ 0.07 secs). We tweak UI plugins such as telescope, nvim-tree, bufferline etc well to provide an aesthetic UI experience.
